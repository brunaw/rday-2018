### [R-Day 2018](http://rday.leg.ufpr.br/)

This is the repository to keep the files for my
presentation in the R-Day 2018, the first national meeting of R users,
happening in 22 May, Curitiba, Brazil. 

The following list represents everything I intend to put here:

- [X] The presentation. 
- [X] Small tutorials for the presented packages. 
- [ ] A brief introduction about music and *music information
retrieval*. 
- [X] A shiny application I want to show during the presentation. 
- [X] Bonus files.
